 * error, which is the standard behavior in high level programming languages.
 * `SafeMath` restores this intuition by reverting the transaction when an
 * operation overflows.

 * Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire
 * class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.
